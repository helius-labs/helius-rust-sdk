/// # RPC Client for Helius
///
/// This module provides access to the Helius API using an RPC client with an embedded Solana client
///
/// ## Errors
///
/// Most methods in this client will return a `Result<T, HeliusError>`, where `HeliusError` can be:
/// - `BadRequest`: Incorrect request format or parameters. Check the path and the text for details
/// - `Unauthorized`: Incorrect or missing API key. Ensure you've provided the correct API key
/// - `NotFound`: The requested resource was not found. This could mean an invalid ID or a non-existent endpoint
/// - `RateLimitExceeded`: Too many requests have been sent in a short period. Consider implementing retries with an exponential backoff
/// - `InternalError`: Server-side errors. These are rare and typically indicate issues on the server side. If these issues persist, please contact Helius support
/// - `Network`: Errors during HTTP communication, typically from underlying network issues
/// - `SerdeJson`: Errors during the serialization or deserialization process
/// - `Unknown`: Catch-all for unclassified errors, with a status code and message provided for further investigation
///
/// Ensure to handle these errors gracefully in your application to maintain robustness and stellar UX
